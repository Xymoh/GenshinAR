# GenshinAR
Mobile app using AR for displaying and using Genshin models with animations

### APP is currently due in development, this is a demo preview as I need to prepare more models and functionality into it

## How to use?

The software works only on Android devices and may work on PC with a camera.

- First we need to target a plane ground for our camera and then tap the screen whenever the square indicator pops

## External libraries and models:

### Vuforia 10.2.5
- [Download](https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/sdk)

### Genshin Impact models were downloaded from there:
- [Liyue Models](https://ys.biligame.com/ysl/)
- [Liyue Models 2](http://ys.biligame.com/pjdkx/)
- [Dodoko event Models](https://www.bilibili.com/blackboard/activity-kiOl0D1nF8.html)
- [Mondstadt Models](https://ys.biligame.com/gczj/)
- [More Models](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/ja/news/detail/5885)

All of these are free for use .pmx models made mainly for Japanese community which are mainly made for MMD (MikuMikuDance) video game.

*Unfortunately .pmx/.mmd models can't work within Unity environment so I had to use these great plugins for blender so I could easily extract bones and models themselves 
into .fbx format. Thank you so much for these golden masterwork!*

Initially it was supposed to be a birthday gift, but unfortunately the person for who this app was made has a smartphone without AR support. [*]
